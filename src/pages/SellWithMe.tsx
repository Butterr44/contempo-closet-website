              You may be wondering, how does Contempo Closet sell clothes? How does Stefanie split profits, 
              how long does it all take, and how much effort do I have to put into selling my old clothes?

              <p>
                We'll schedule a convenient time for me to meet you for pick up, or items can be left in a secure location for pick up. 
                After pick up, the items go to Contempo to start the processing phase. (Any items not accepted due to flaws, stains, or style 
                can be donated on client's behalf or returned)

                  <li>Tracking. I record everything on detailed spreadsheets so all goods are properly accounted for.</li>
                  <li>Spot treatment. If clothes need a little extra love before they're listed, they get the spot treatment.</li>
                  <li>Photography. I photograph clothes in my at-home studio.</li>
                  <li>Research. How much should a product sell for? I leverage my 15+ years of reselling experience to figure it out.</li>
                  <li>Listing. I'll cross-list the item to eBay and Poshmark, staking my brand on client products.</li>
                  <li>Storage. I label, store, and package inventory for shipping.</li>
                  <li>Shipping. Once something sells, I print the label, package the item, and drop it off at the post office to be shipped.</li>
                  <li>Payment. Client payments are made approximately every 8 weeks via Venmo.</li>
